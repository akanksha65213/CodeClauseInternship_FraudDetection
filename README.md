# CodeClause Internship Project  
## Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project was developed as part of the **CodeClause Data Science Internship**.

## Project Aim
To detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques.

## Description
The project analyzes a highly imbalanced credit card transaction dataset and applies both supervised and anomaly detection approaches to identify fraudulent activities.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Approach
- Data preprocessing and analysis
- Handling imbalanced datasets
- Logistic Regression (Classification)
- Isolation Forest (Anomaly Detection)
- Evaluation using Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix

## Key Learning
- Fraud detection in real-world datasets
- Importance of recall over accuracy
- Working with imbalanced data
- Applying multiple ML approaches

## Dataset
Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset (Kaggle)

## Note
Due to dataset size, the CSV file is not included. Please download it from Kaggle.


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset** from Kaggle.

Due to GitHub file size limits, the dataset is not included in this repository.

## Results
- Logistic Regression achieved high accuracy but lower fraud recall due to data imbalance.
- Isolation Forest improved fraud detection by treating frauds as anomalies.
- Recall was prioritized over accuracy due to the high cost of false negatives.
